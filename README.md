# BookmarkExtension

Better Bookmark Chrome extension is made to solve a popular problem among users: Multiple tabs (normally > 20 tabs) are still open but it is time to go to bed. Of course, Chrome has a great bookmark function that saves the most recent links which can be opened just by one click, but if you accidentally go to a random site and forget to open the links that you were working on yesterday, Chrome will not save all of your links as a whole anymore, and remembering all of them to reopen is tough.

Demo version on Chrome (not published): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-bookmark/knffcfcgbkoikjehmfgkodnlhagfcakj

The extension is simply made up of HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery with the use of Chrome Storage API to store users data and make it available across devices. In order to retrieve bookmarks, users have to log in Chrome with their Google account and the extension will automatically sync the bookmarks.

The outstanding feature is that you can not only add one link as a bookmark (like what you normally do with Chrome bookmark), but you can add all the open links on your current Chrome window with the (date|time) given or with the title of your own choice! You can also delete your bookmarks or overwrite your bookmarks at any time.




Additional notes:
* Extension logo needs to be 19*19 px  PNG file
* Overwrite function has been implemented but be careful with updating bookmarks with an existing name. You may lose your old data saved with that title.
